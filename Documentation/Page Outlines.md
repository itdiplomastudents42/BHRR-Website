<h1> Page Outlines - Updated per feedback regularly </h1>

Each of the following headers denotes a page on the website. The components of the page are ordered according to the feedback specification - going from top of page downward. 

<h2>HOME</h2>
<ul>- 1. Call To Action (CTA) at the top. Example text: "Let's flip the conversation from waste to resources </ul>
<ul>- 2. What we do: brief overview.</ul>
<ul>- 3. Headline metric strip of weight statistics.
The client would like to try a dynamic strip that moves across the page for the weight statistic. We should have one design variation that can express this/ ask them about it on Monday. </ul>
<ul>- 4. What are we up to? (eg. Latest event - think about wording) </ul>
<ul>- 5. Latest News: Maybe not as a separate item on the home page; perhaps as a drop-down under something else.</ul>
<ul>- 6. Community highlight: From document: "maybe not as a separate item on the home page as time sensitive. But we could perhaps have something which includes it. Weâ€™ll think about this before Monday!"</ul>
<ul>- 7. Client unsure if they want to include "Get involved/Contact" at the bottom of the home page since it's already at the top in the menu bar. They also believe that "Partner with us" seems to fit better on the contact page </ul>
