<h1> Page Outlines - Updated per feedback regularly </h1>

Each of the following headers denotes a page on the website. The components of the page are ordered according to the feedback specification - going from top of page downward. 

Underneath each header is the proposed Menu Bar drop-down options when you hover-over/click-on a particular header item. (I'm not sure if this is what they mean in the notes document when they mention "drop-downs", so I am just covering our bases).

<h2>HOME</h2>

<ul>- 1. Call To Action (CTA) at the top. Example text: "Let's flip the conversation from waste to resources </ul>
<ul>- 2. What we do: brief overview.</ul>
<ul>- 3. Headline metric strip of weight statistics.
The client would like to try a dynamic strip that moves across the page for the weight statistic. We should have one design variation that can express this/ ask them about it on Monday. </ul>
<ul>- 4. What are we up to? (eg. Latest event - think about wording) </ul>
<ul>- 5. Latest News: Maybe not as a separate item on the home page; perhaps as a drop-down under something else.</ul>
<ul>- 6. Community highlight: From document: "maybe not as a separate item on the home page as time sensitive. But we could perhaps have something which includes it. We’ll think about this before Monday!"</ul>
<ul>- 7. Client unsure if they want to include "Get involved/Contact" at the bottom of the home page since it's already at the top in the menu bar. They also believe that "Partner with us" seems to fit better on the contact page </ul>


<h2>ABOUT/OUR STORY</h2>
<h4> Menu bar drop-down proposals: Testimonials;  </h4>

<ul>- 1. Story/history: how we began etc.</ul>
<ul>- 2. Mission/mission statement</ul>
<ul>- 3. Co-founders photos</ul>
<ul>- 4. Impact: From document: "drop downs to testimonials? Links build to local community organisations. Potential to change these over time."</ul>
<ul>- 5. Praise section: From document: "would see this down at the bottom of the page, like an “Our Friends” which would include Swinburne, Boroondara Council, North Balwyn Rotary, PALM, Bunnings?"</ul>

<h2>COMMUNITY (inc.EVENTS)</h2>
<h4> Menu bar drop-down proposals: Events(link to FB events page->);  </h4>

The details are a bit hazy on the order/layout, but the following are components to include on the page.

<ul>- 1. Organisations that BHRR supports (Community impact)</ul>
<ul>- 2. Rehomie makers/creatives (Community creatives)</ul>
<ul>- 3. Testimonials (pending): From document: "We’d keep media mentions to one place. But this could include testimonials.  Would these link to any testimonials on the About page?"</ul>
<ul>- 4. Drop-down menu to cover Events: 
  <ul>- a. Link to FB events page (if not in menu bar drop-down)</ul>
  <ul>- b. Events we're invited to (eg. Council events)</ul>
  <ul>- c. BHRRs own events (eg. The Spring Community Market)</ul>
</ul>

<h2>RESOURCES</h2>

Again, the details are a bit more murky for this page, though we do have a general concept.

<ul>- 1. BHRRs A-Z Rehoming Guide</ul>
<ul>- 2. Links to useful Council information</ul>
<ul>- 3. FAQs: eg. Where do I take...; I have to clear a deceased estate- where do I start...; etc.</ul>
