<h2> Pre-Sep/01-Meeting </h2>

<h3> Summary: </h3>
We require a dynamic website to be a complementary landing point, rather than a primary landing point. We already have a significant point of contact with the FB Rehomie community (through the FB group function).

<h3> Objectives: </h3>
<h4> Increase Engagement </h4>
Think of it more as **broadening** engagement, rather than _increasing_ engagement. Facebook is "transactional". The website will be more educational and informative. 
We’re not doing it to build “likes”.

<h4> Grow Client Base </h4>
We think more in terms of **Grow BHRR Reach**. Create a website that effectively showcases BHRR’s services (which includes education, information, referrals, volunteer opportunities).

<h4> Excution </h4> – timelines for specific content will be helpful. We will no doubt need to write and rewrite along the way. What’s the ad campaign?



<h3> Questions postured </h3>

1. What CMS are you using?

2. (Relating to email/marketing campaigns) - What do you mean? Does this relate to a quarterly newsletter/ member-based subscriptions?

3. Does "digital marketing solution" mean the website? How would you measure success? In terms of traffic tot the page? Can you measure time spent on pages?

4. (Relating to integration of social media platform) - How would you do this? Is this "back end" functionality, to enable us to turn Facebook content into a web-based blog? OR is it "front end", enabling users to click through to the Facebook site/joining questions? Or connecting Rehomies to the website?

5. <h3> SECURITY???? </h3>

6. (In relation to planning) - What digital assets will you audit? Are you searching for other mentions of BHRR? (Eg. Media mentions in local newspapers, council page, local MP's, social media, and other mentions, ABC video)

7. (In relation to execution) - What’s the ad campaign?

8. (In relation to evaluation) - How is this assessed? What are the predifined KPI's? Is the final report something we get to see, or is it internal?

9. 

<h3> Page Style Questions Postured </h3>

<h4> Home: </h4>


<h4> Our Story (rather than "About"): </h4>


<h4> Our Community: </h4>


<h4> Events: </h4>
**IMPORTANT**: "Roll this into the Community section. We’re not involved in enough for it to warrant it’s own heading in the menu bar. Also, they’re very community based and the nature of events means they’re dynamic and people aren’t going to a website to look for events. That where FB shines – the relevant drop down menu could also include a link the BHRR’s FB Event’s page. This would then highlight events we’re invited to (eg. Council events) as well as BHRR’s own events (eg. The Spring Community Market).

Instead of having **Events**, have a **RESOURCES** tab."

<h4> Resources: </h4>

(Not a question, but important to note for reference)
"Things that we’d include in this would be:
   <ul> • BHRR’s A-Z Rehoming Guide </ul>
   <ul> • Links to useful Council information </ul>
   <ul> • FAQs – eg. Where do I take….; I have to clear a deceased estate – where do I start…" </ul>

Editors note:
  Something to note is the multiple mentions of "clearing a deceased estate"; this topic is clearly important to the clients and may hold some value or history beyond BHRR. We should be approaching our conversations regarding this with the uptmost respect and sincerity. (No funny business)

<h4> Donate: </h4>
"We also need a **Donate** menu item at the top. This would lead to a general “finances” page, which would include:"
   <ul> • A “donate” button (with a brief explanation of what the donation will help with) </ul>
   <ul> • Link to Das Tshirt Automat and our merch </ul>
   <ul> • Link to CDS – donate bottles and cans </ul>
   <ul> • Hire our equipment (clothes racks, coat hangers and bunting. Would need a drop down menu which would show photos of the equipment and the hire cost. </ul>
